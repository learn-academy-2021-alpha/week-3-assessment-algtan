# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
  Object destructuring allows you to grab the key-value pairs within an object and store them within a variable. The variable needs to be the same name as the "key."

  Researched answer:
  Destructuring is a way of "unpacking" an object into variables because it might be more manageable to work with.


2. What are React lifecycle methods? Provide three examples.

  Your answer:
  React lifecycle methods are methods that take place during the beginning and end of a component's lifecycle. Two examples include mount and unmount (cannot thinkn of a third).

  Researched answer:
  A React component has three phases within its lifecycle: 1) mounting, 2) updating, 3) unmounting. A lifecycle method is a method that is ran to coincide with one of the three phases. Three lifecycle methods include 1) constructor(), 2) render(), and 3) componentDidMount(). All three are ran during the 'mounting' phase. The render() function is also used during the 'updating' phase.


3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  The difference between a class and an object is that a class serves as the blueprint for an object, and is very similar to a function. An object on the other hand will contain key-value pairs that hold information and/or methods.

  Researched answer:
  Classes are specific functions used as a template for the creation of objects. A class will define the object (a.k.a. instance) properties and behavior (methods). Classes are reusable similar to functions, whereas an object would be similar to a variable of the class.


4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer:
  An HTML div is a tag used to group HTML elements, and does not have a limit as long as it is contained in the HTML body. A span on the otherhand also groups HTML elements, but it only does so across the page one time.

  Researched answer:
  An HTML div tag is a 'block' level element, meaning that it goes across the entire page. An HTML span tag on the other hand is an 'inline' element, meaning it can be used to capture specific items within a line of the page.


5. What is a React Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer:
  A React Fragment is used to group JSX code, and you would use it if you have multiple elements within your JSX code.

  Researched answer:
  A React Fragment is used to return multiple elements by wrapping the elements together. You would use a React Fragment to avoid adding more nodes to the DOM, as another way of wrapping elements together are with 'div' tags.


6. What does it mean to create a responsive UI? What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:
  A responsive UI is one that responds to user actions. One option for creating a responsive design is to have methods that respond to events, like 'onClick.'

  Researched answer:
  A responsive UI is one that will render a user interface based on the device screen or program window. Three techniques are needed for responsive design: 1) fluid grids, 2) fluid images, 3) media queries.


7. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  Props are data and methods passed from a parent component to a child component.

  Researched answer:
  Props is short for properties, and it is how data and methods are passed between different components.


8. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  In JavaScript, 'this' refers to the parent object containing data or methods.

  Researched answer:
  In JavaScript, 'this' refers to the current calling context. If 'this' is called within an object, it will use the object as the current calling context.


9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  The ternary operator is used as a shorthand for an if/else conditional.

  Researched answer:
  The ternary operator is a shorter way of creating if/else conditional statements in JavaScript. The word 'ternary' is an adjective meaning that it has three parts. In this case, there are three parts for the ternary operator: 1) a condition, 2) an expression to execute if the condition is true, and 3) an expression to execute if the condition is false.


10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  An anonymous function in JavaScript is one that was not given a name.

  Researched answer:
  An anonymous function is one that does not have a name. As a result, it is not usually accessible after it is initially called.
